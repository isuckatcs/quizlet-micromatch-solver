# A simple JavaScript that matches Quizlet cards.

# How to use
1.) Open a Quizlet micromatch game <br>
2.) Open the console, paste and run the script <br>
3.) Set the time you want to achieve and start the game<br>

*Apparently Firefox is the only browser in which the script doesn't work.*

Note: 
- the script only works in micromatch mode which is NOT equal to match. (e.g.: https://quizlet.com/509463843/micromatch)
- Quizlet can't save a time less than 0.5s
- the script can only solve tasks where text has to matched with text.
